# Student-Finance-Scheme-Web-Page
# Overview
The Student Finance Scheme Web Page project is designed to provide a user-friendly platform for students interested in pursuing courses in CAD/CAM/CAE/IT software. The web page combines an EMI calculator and an application form to overcome financial barriers and simplify the enrollment process. This README provides an in-depth understanding of the project, its features, technologies used, usage instructions, credits, and licensing.

# Features
**EMI Calculator:** The web page features an interactive EMI calculator that allows users to calculate Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) for various loan amounts and tenures. Users input their loan amount, initial amount, and select a tenure from the provided options. The calculator then dynamically displays the calculated EMI, interest rate, and other relevant details.

**Application Form:** The application form enables prospective students to easily apply for the "Study Now and Pay Later" student finance scheme. The form collects essential information such as the student's name, mobile number, loan amount, initial amount, selected tenure, and course preferences. This streamlined form simplifies the enrollment process and encourages more applicants to apply.

**Dynamic Content:** JavaScript is used to enhance the user experience by dynamically updating the EMI calculation results table and hidden input fields for form submission. This real-time interaction ensures that users receive accurate information without needing to refresh the page.

**Google Script URLs:** The form data submitted by users is processed and stored using Google Script URLs. These URLs enable the secure handling of user data and its interaction with external services, possibly Google Sheets or other Google services.

# Technologies Used
**HTML:** The core markup language that structures the content of the web page, including forms, images, and text.

**CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are employed for styling and layout, enhancing the visual appeal and responsiveness of the web page. The emi.css file, linked in the HTML, likely contains the CSS rules for styling the page.

**JavaScript:** JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic behavior. It's used for calculations, form validation, updating content, and handling form submissions. The inline JavaScript code within the HTML file manages the EMI calculator and form interactions.

# Usage
